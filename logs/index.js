// This is just a placeholder file, when bunyan creates logs, it sends them to this directory.
// Since git ignores the actual log files, if I don't have this file here, git won't see this directory.
// Having this file here allows git to see this directory in commits. Just a precaution to make sure the directory doesn't exist when anyone clones or downloads the project
