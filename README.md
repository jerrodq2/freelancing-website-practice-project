#About

A freelancing website based off of the concepts of sites such as upwork. This is a practice project, it is not intended to become an in production website. The technologies used are Node.js with Express.js for the backend, Postgres for the database, and ReactJS for the starting front end. The starting focus of this project is on code quality, enforcing code standards with ESLint, connecting Node.js with React.js, unit testing, stronger github practices, and continous integration via Circleci.

## Getting Started
You need Node.js and postgres installed to use this project locally.

To get started, download the project and run the following command to create the database with the most recent migrations and seed data. This command can also be used to rest the database at any time.
```
npm run db:reset
```
