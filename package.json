The technologies used are Node.js with Express.js for the backend, Postgres for the database, and ReactJS for the starting front end. The starting focus of this project is on code quality, enforcing code standards with ESLint, connecting Node.js with React.js, unit testing, stronger github practices, and continous integration via Circleci.",
